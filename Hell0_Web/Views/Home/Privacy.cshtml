        This application collects zero data. Zilch. Nada. We don't even know you're here.

    <p style="color: #8888aa;">
        No cookies (except the ones ASP.NET Core insists on for anti-forgery tokens—blame Microsoft, not me).<br>
        No tracking. No analytics. No ad networks. No selling your ASCII art preferences to Tessier-Ashpool.<br>

        Your text never leaves your browser request. It gets rendered server-side and forgotten immediately.<br>
        We're not even logging it. This is a portfolio demo, not a surveillance apparatus.
